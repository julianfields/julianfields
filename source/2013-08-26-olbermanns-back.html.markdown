OLBERMANN'S BACK

 And a glorious day to all of you!  As in life the world of sports keeps
on ticking.  Drama, suspense, PED's and lets not forget, College
Football kicks of this week. No one is more excited to start what I
hope to call a successful betting campaign than myself.  The only question is do I
start this week or wait till the elite programs face some actual
opponents.  I'm sure most cappers would say "get to work"!  

Johnny Football continues to make headlines, but not for the right
reasons.  It's seems like a lifetime ago when I was watching workouts
of Manziel on the beaches of San Diego with scouts and coaches toting
his work ethic and progressions as a QB. Who's to blame, Media?  NCAA?
 Or Manziel himself?  Wait for it... Of course I have an
opinion, I say all of the above.

The media needs stories, and until the autograph for pay headlines, the
biggest story about Johnny Manziel was courtside seats at NBA games, ranting tweets and pics with celebrities.  None of which warrent any attention, unless of course you're the first freshman to ever when the Heisman Trophy Award. 

The NCAA is a the biggest gang of them all, they've been profiting off student athletes for years.  they make the rules and enforce them, so if Manziel broke the rules, he will likely have to suffer the consequences, but it seems to me that the conversation is finally open regarding student athlets, the NCAA and all the money! 

Now ultimately, I can't tell you if Manziel did or did not take money
for autographs.  I don't care who he takes pictures with or what game
he's at.  He does fit the characteristics of a sophomore in college.
howevern thhe microscope and spotlights are on him. So to him I advise, as I hope
people in his circle do, be careful what you put out in the media
and what you do.  Partying and rediculous tweets are going to draw
attention.  He must hold himself to a higher standard.  Act like a pro,
behave like a pro the rest will take care of it's self.  I'm
glad the season is almost here and we can move on to bigger and better
stories.

Lastly, welcome back Keith Olbermann.  The ESPN anchor turned political talk show host is back with ESPN for an hour long daily show.  Love him or hate him, Olbermann helped grow
SportCenter into the show it is today, his opinions are sure to raise some eybrows, but don't doubt his expertise.  He will deliver, even if for the sole purpose to piss people off!  You can watch Olbermann's show "Olbermann"  weeknights at 10 pm EST on ESPN2.

Stay thirsty my friends, and remember, it ain't the coffee, it's the
juice!
