A very Happy Birthday to my father David Fields.  A legend in his own
right.  My dad is an adventurer to start. his stories of travel started
as a young boy with his father in eastern Oregon.  Tales of teenage
trips to Mexico with $10 bucks in his pocket, hitchhiking with friends
are stories I was raised hearing about.  Over the years, Inda and Peru
have sparked his interest.  Exploring temples, and ruins and jungles,
and sitting with yogi's are all things that have shaped him and rubbed
off on me.

His spiritualiy is a huge part of his life, a way of life.  Like travel,
his spiritual exploration has taken him to the deepest crevices and
cracks of the mind and soul.  An exploration that has made him a
teacher, a father, and a friend.

Happy 61st Dad.  thank you for the years of love and support.  You are
big reason I am who I am today!
