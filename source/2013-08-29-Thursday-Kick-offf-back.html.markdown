For any who may have thought Peyton Manning was done, well, he proved you
wrong on Thursday night versus the Super Bowl Champions.  The Ravens
played tough during the 1st half.  They went into the locker room with a
lead 17-14.  

The sleeping giant woke up the 2nd half.  Manning picked apart the
Ravens defense, who no longer have All Pro Ray Lewis and Ed Reed to
anchor the D.  Manning set tied an NFL record with 7 touchdowns,
completing 27 of 42 passes for a whopping 462 yeard and no int's.  

Fans of the Broncos were stoked, fans of football were refreshed on who
still is the greatest current quarterback and Fantasy football teams
were extatic.  If this is a formula for the rest of teh year, I think we
will be seeing Manning in the Super Bowl.  The question is can he
finish?  We'll have to wait an see, its only week one, and Friday for
that matter!
