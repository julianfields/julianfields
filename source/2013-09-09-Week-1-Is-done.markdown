Ducks? or Beavers?  The conversation and discussion has been going on
for years.  Families draw lines, husband and wives route against each
other, and people who never went ot UofO route for the Ducks.  So why
the sad face Beaver fans.  Corvallis is a nice place, Reser Stadium is
1/2 finished and it's Halloween everday in your sweat little rurar
community.

I know I know, but Julian, you're a Beaver.  I sure am, and really tired
of paying student loans.  Tired of Orange and Black almost as much as
PSU and UofP students owning season tickets to Autzen in Eugene.  Oh
well of banter for now, good luck to both teams.:
