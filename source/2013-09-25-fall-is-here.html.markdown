I've never been much of a believer in luck.  More recently I've been
pondering the idea of hard work, and planning, and payoff.  I do believe
things take work, and sometimes a plan can help reach a goal.  Sometimes
with a plan and some work, we can be rewarded.  What that rewards is may
vary.  Maybe it's fiscal, maybe it's spiritual or maybe it's simply
more free time.   My conclusion is not fully made but I will say this.  I believe timing, and
vision, and fate play some part in the grand scheme of things.  

Several months ago my career took a turn and I was forced to
make a decision for my future employment.  I'd been working in my family
business in coffee and tea.  I was ready for a change, ready for
something I could really sink my teeth into, and ulitimately what I was
hoping would be a natural transition was more like a kawaam!  "You need
to find new work, today!"

Several weeks went by, I looked for some new jobs, new careers paths.
I was getting very little traction.  I sat on my deck in the sun, asking
big questions about direction, I asked for guidence, I had moments of
craziness and frustration as well as long periods of silence and
relaxation.  I stared for hours at paintings on my wall.  These painting
were painted by a man named Michael Parenteau, who had recently moved back to Portand after nearly eight years in Ohio and
North Carolina.

Michael is an artist, who had learned to code and was now
developing software.  Much like anyone who is interested in something, I
began asking questions.  These questions turned into conversations,
which turned into more questions until finally, I bought a new computer, and began
learning code. Michael agreed to be my mentor in the world of vim, terminals, ruby,
rails, html, css and so much more.  Oh, and I was able to work out a deal
that brought me back to the family business to help with this
transition.  So, I must say, this is requiring work, and a bit of a plan,
but the universe ulitimately listened to my request.  There is nothing
that can explain the timing at which Michael and I re-connected.  Or the
the perfection at which things have come together.  I don't have any
clue where this path will take me. I do know that it will be one heck of a
ride!

Eastwind is a vision that manifested over the last couple months.  It
began as a sports blog about college football and quickly sank.  I'm a
surfer, a husband, a son, and most importantly a traveler both literally
and cosmically.  My wife is a marathon runner, my brother is a music
producer, my sister is a dancing bohemian, my mother and father are
spiritual seekers.

We are all on the endless search.  Waves, rythms, hymns, satsangs,
sunrises and sunsets.  I've spent many days looking around the next
corner for waves of perfection, where winds are offshore, and in Oregon
that would mean east winds.  Places where empty lineups of perfectly
groomed lines rolled in to hit sanbars and points and reefs.  Long live
the search is metaphor for my travels and life.  An idea that no matter
what life throws at us, embrace it.  Live life and while we're here,
live the search.
