Ever since I was a young boy I have been fascinated by traveling and
exploring.  My grandfather on my dad side was the first Fields to
travel to the Amazon.  My dad is there now and has been going to the
Peruvian Amazon for a number of years.  I have been fortunate enough
to join him on one ocassion.  

It was no coincidence that I would become a surfer.  One of the earliest
pictures of me was in Hawaii with a snorkel and mask in my underwear.
I used to swim in the mud puddles at the school up the street when I was
a kid.  by the time I was 8 or 9 I had a boogie board and a funky old
wetsuit.  The kind with a beaver tail and only covered your upper body.
hardly enough to keep you warm in the 50 degree waters of Oregon, but as
I recall it didn't stop me.

Surfing and travel go hand in hand.  I rarely leave
the country without
a board bag and I like it that way.  I prefer to travel to warm waters,
having plenty of rubber and cold at home in Oregon.  One of my biggest
attractions to surf and travel is the simplicity of it all.  Whether I'm
gone for a week or a month, I take about the same amount of gear.  it
usually consists of some trunks, tees, a few books, sunscreen and some
wax.  Oh, maybe an extra pair of sandals. 

I've learned so much about myself and life in my travels.  Nothing
really last, I rarely make it home with my boards in one piece.  People
all over the world are proud and charismatic.  Pride is a double edge
sword in what I'm referring to is the natural love people have for where
they call home.  Most importantly, I know that I can survive happily
with only a bag of boards and clothes.  

I enjoy the ammenities life in the U.S. affords.  Clean water, cable
T.V. among other things, but often times I feel life in the States is so
complicated.  The rat race of American living tends to burn us out and
leave us needing more coffee just to get through the day.  I prefer
coffee in a hammock with a book waiting for the next swell to roll in.
Of course it requires some sort of currency to keep this type of life
going, and I'm far from retired, but, I do believe that you can find
away to have balance and live a more simple life.  What do you think?
