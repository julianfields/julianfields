*I sat down with Michael Parenteau last fall and discussed design, art
and life.  Our relationship goes back nearly 20 years to when I was
about 12 years old and he was 18 years old.  A random meeting brought him to my families farm in
Newberg, Oregon.  We found a common interest in music, most notably The
Grateful Dead.  Fast forward 20 years, and many travels later, our paths crossed again, still
a love for the Dead, but now both working professionals.* 

*Michael is the Creative Director at Cognitect, a software product and consulting
company.  He is also a painter, a husband and a father.  For the past two years
Michael's has been my mentor in design and coding.
Here is our interview, I hope you enjoy!*

**What was your path to getting where you are today?**

My path started in art specifically.  My first interest in art was my father.  I would ask him to draw  me a football, and the football would turn an arm and the arm to a player, with helmet, and  pads and cleats and running!  

It was my first memory and means a lot to me. The idea that from asking for a drawing of a football came this whole story.  The idea of making something out of nothing.  From there, drawing, and painting and sculpting.  Then, I got really into pschadellic poster art, Height Ashbury San Francisco Grateful Dead posters.  

Finally, having my daughter, I needed to provide for more than just myself, there was a bigger purpose.  So, I was led to graphic design, advertising, posters, business cards etc.  I started my own business and was really busy, but around 2005, when the economy crashed, print art was slowing down, and people started asking if I could do web pages, and I said yeah, sure, and then started learning HTML and CSS and websites.  This led to making websites, and getting some design chops and ulitimately this led me to software and working with people to help solve problems

different kind of task oriented problems that are of interest, a specific task where computers solve the problem.  Managing machines, email, todo list.  A number tools we use on a daily basis that we often don’t think about the design that goes in to it.

Making tools to solve problems.
Visualizing information
now that we have these tools, we’re collecting this informaton.

**Where did you grow up?**

I grew up all over the place, Born in Mass, where my folks met,
moved to suburb outside columbus, OH, Dublin
stayed in Ohio until graduating high school, last few years of high school, half the day in Dublin dong pre recs for college, and the 2nd ½ of the day a fine arts high school in fort Hayes.  And then eventually moved to the west coast, San Francicso and Portland.

**Has where you grew up influenced your art and design?**

yes, definitely for the fine arts high school, about sketch booking and the process of work,
friends being influenced with Grateful Dead music and the posters that inspired you.

**Was there an aha moment when you new design and programming is what you wanted to do?**

Yeah but like the biggest aha moment was, well its a little out there but it was after a Grateful Dead concert, I think sophmore year of high school, around 2 or 3 in the morning, I had a very interesting day and I was sitting there and had a moment, this realization that I am an artist, I am here to make stuff.  I looked at my buddy and told him, I’m going to be an artist for the rest of my life.  This stuck with me, and over time, there have been moments or aha of different steps and along the way and what the medium is in terms of making art.  Like learning photo shop and design tools for the visual aspect, than wanting to make things that people can touch and interact with, and so programming kind of came that way.

**Where do you draw your inspiration?**

People, I think people.  You know there is different kind of inspirations.  There’s like my daughter being born and having to get my shit together. there’s nature, with patterns and inspiration everywhere.  I’ve worked in two different kinds of environments,  one in my studio by myself generating stuff, but it doesn't stop there, as soon as your done generating something, a very important part is sharing the art, getting it out of the studio, in order to get feeback, or a response.  I’ve been looking at it, getting all these thoughts and diologue, but in order to get out of my head and not be crazy, I need to get a response from people.

the other environment is the collaborative environement, and the internet gives us the ability to have access to so many people and so much feeback.  Working in the collaborive environement is really special, it gives me a great deal of inspiration.

**Have you had any mentors?**

Yeah, artist mentors, Zach Colburn was my buddy who introduced me to Fort Hayes, a great painter and tattoo artist in Columbus, Ohio. A good buddy of mine, Brendon Ward, introduced me to the really cool poster from the psychedelic 60’s scene.  Both played a huge influence as big brother figures.

My art teachers at Ft. Hayes, Ken Valimackey and Phill Arena, incredible role models in terms of artist who had taken a professional path and were also doing great things for the community.

Moving out of that space and into the digital world, Fred Knack here in Portland, he had seen me making art, drawing and painting and he said you should really pick up a computer.  He taught me a bunch of stuff about programing, at that time it was like flash and stuff like that.  I had all sorts of questions, at the time Fred was making websites for large companies.  Along the way when I wanted to figure out how to become a hacker I would call fred and ask what css and html and all this stuff is.

Joe Payton, Joe was someone who helped realize that, he said “if somebody made it once, than you can make it too.”  If the problem has been solved, than you can solve that problem, and same goes for making stuff.  Fabulous artist with some real programming chops.

one last person, was Mines Casel, he used to work for cognitect, mines was a systems guys, always thinking about process and thought a lot about thinking, rather than just doing.  Being effective vs being efficient, and he really challenged me in my personal growth.




**Are you creatively satisfied?**

No, (laughing), thats a very simple answer.  You know there is a saying that, we can all be our owns worst critic, we always see the imperfections.  When we’re really close to whatevever we’re doing, You are in the middle of something and you sometimes have to keep going, you , you’ve invested all this time and sometimes you just have to keep going, and you can see that moment of time and the imperfection, and it happens multiple times.   Theres a balance between saying its good enough and wanting to go back and fix something., clean it up, but then theres also, I’ve been doing this awhile and you have dreams for other projects and things you want to do.  If I ever find myself creatively satisfied, new career.

**What is good design?**

Umm, something that you generally don’t think about.  I think that good design is the kind of thing that's just sort of, doing it’s job.  Something that was thought through, worked on and integrated in to peoples lives where it just does whats it's supposed to, and we assimilate to that.  There's verying degrees of design.  What is design, the idea behind design is actually about thinking through something and putting tools in place or process in place, it could be a music score to a lamp to a website to a language, clothing, literally everything in the world around us is designed.  There's an interplay between being aware and unaware.   overtime, things change, so a design may become irrelevant over time and so we constantly revisit the design of something.  Everything at one time was thought out with someone trying to solve a problem.  We dont always know how things will change.  

Good design is really the kind of thing that just lasts, and sits there and does its job we don’t think about it.  Bad design is the kind of thing, its not really bad design,  it's just something that could have been designed and people had good thoughts about, but things change, and time has changed an pains are felt, the context has changed.  We start to talk about it, the problem could be in the way we look at that thing.  We may point the blame, but at the time there was a reason for why things were designed, not so much good or bad, its just design.  

What’s your favorite cuss word?

hahaha, my favorite cuss word, you know fuck is a good one, that is a really good one, you know theres that paper about how many ways you can use the word fuck, its a noun, an adjective, an adverb, it can be a name.  You can pretty much use the word fuck in any linguistic context and it works!

**What advice do you give to someone starting out in programming?**

Um, in programming, start with a problem, really understand the problem you’re trying to solve, and then look for solutions out there that might have already solved the problem.  Start by looking for a solution that already exists.  If you can, take it apart, figure out how that solution solves the problem, you could let that lead you into what language it was written in, other people in the community  working in the language.  It’s kind of like if you want to tell a story, you kind of need to have a story, you could know how to read and write or have a pen and paper. You can do pen and paper, but if you don’t have a story you’re not going to write, and I think the same rings true for programming. If you have a problem, that will lead you into solutions, technology, and people, and all the other things you need to do it. That’s number one.

Then, just do it. Get in, Start somewhere, start anywhere.   Get familiar with tools that are used in programming, get familiar with a text editor, with syntax highlighting, get familiar with the terminal, browser tools, whatever, because there’s lots of different kinds of programming, maybe its programming video games, I don’t have a clue about the tools used for making video games.  There's a whole tool change for that.  Get familiar with the tools, know your problems, look for solutions, and keep going, because thats the big one, just keep going and learning.

**Where do you see yourself in 10 years?**

On a farm, (laughing)  I see myself out in the country, with  wicked fast internet but no cell phone reception.  I imagine a little house and a big farm, some crops I attend to certain amount of time through out the day or year, making art sometime throughout the day in that barn. Chicken and animals all that stuff, and I imagine being set up in a way that I have done enough work in design and in making products that hopefully my time can scale in those other areas.  Maybe I have made some things that kind of work on there own.  I will always make things and continue to consult and work with teams of people and i will always design things but imagine being in a very different space than I am today. that I am set up
